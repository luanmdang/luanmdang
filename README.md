Hello friends!

I like to build tools I actually use, usually because the existing options aren't free.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of systems and AI. I like understanding how things work under the hood, and I like when software makes someone's day a little easier (it does for me!).

**Lately:**

I built [Swiftly](https://github.com/luanmdang/swiftly), an open-source macOS dictation app that lives in your menu bar. Hold a key, speak, release - your words appear wherever you're typing, cleaned up by a local Whisper model and an optional LLM pass. I use it every day.

At [Neurotrack](https://neurotrack.com), I'm building a platform that processes 88,000+ clinical records, using GPT-4 to extract structured medical data from messy inputs. The care-pathway engine is modeled on UCSF's Care Ecosystem protocol.

Previously at Strategic Risk Solutions, I built a RAG chatbot that took 32 seconds per query during the first half of my internship. Got it down to 2-3 seconds through caching and query optimization in the second half, then built an ingestion pipeline on Azure that improved retrieval accuracy by 35%!
