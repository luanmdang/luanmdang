**Stanford CS | Systems & AI Engineer**

I build software where performance meets intelligence. From optimizing RAG pipelines for the insurance industry to architecting healthcare platforms for cognitive health, I focus on building tools that are fast, reliable, and native.

## 📖 The Story So Far

### 🧠 Scaling Healthcare Intelligence
At **Neurotrack**, I am currently bridging the gap between raw clinical data and actionable medical insights.
* **The Impact:** Developed a full-stack platform processing **88,000+ clinical records**, utilizing GPT-4 integration to transform messy data into structured medical extractions.
* **The Complexity:** Engineered a care-pathway engine modeled on **UCSF's Care Ecosystem**, implementing a 7-step protocol algorithm for clinical recommendations.

### 🏎️ Solving the "Latency Problem"
During my time at **Strategic Risk Solutions**, I transformed a sluggish AI search tool into a production-ready asset.
* **The Win:** Inherited a RAG chatbot for insurance queries and **reduced latency from 32 seconds to 2-3 seconds** through aggressive caching and query optimization.
* **The Infrastructure:** Designed an automated ingestion pipeline integrating Azure Blob Storage with AI Search, improving retrieval accuracy by **35%**.

### 💻 Native Craftsmanship
I have a deep interest in how software interacts with hardware and systems.
* **Notch-Prompter:** Instead of ignoring the MacBook notch, I turned it into a tool. Using **AppKit and Carbon APIs**, I built a native teleprompter that detects screen geometry to adapt the UI based on hardware specs.
* **Virtual Systems:** To explore OS internals, I architected a **Unix-like file system** from scratch, featuring hierarchical directory structures, path resolution, and a custom command parser with 15+ commands.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
* **Languages:** Python, C++, C, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift
* **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Flask, PyTorch, SwiftUI
* **Cloud & Tools:** Azure (AI Search/Blob), AWS (EC2), Docker, Git, PostGIS

## 🎵 Beyond the Code
When I'm not in the terminal, I’m exploring **Audio DSP**. I’m fascinated by signal processing and look forward to blending my computer science background with real-time audio synthesis and music technology.

## 📊 Stats & Impact
* **90%** reduction in LLM query latency.
* **88k+** medical records processed via custom parsers.
* **Sub-100ms** latency achieved in real-time messaging systems.
