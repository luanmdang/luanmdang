**Stanford CS | Systems & AI Engineer**

I build software where performance meets intelligence. [cite_start]From optimizing RAG pipelines for the insurance industry to architecting healthcare platforms for cognitive health, I focus on building tools that are fast, reliable, and native[cite: 5, 13, 19, 35].

## 📖 The Story So Far

### 🧠 Scaling Healthcare Intelligence
[cite_start]At **Neurotrack**, I am currently bridging the gap between raw clinical data and actionable medical insights[cite: 11, 13].
* [cite_start]**The Impact:** Developed a full-stack platform processing **88,000+ clinical records**, utilizing GPT-4 integration to transform messy data into structured medical extractions[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**The Complexity:** Engineered a care-pathway engine modeled on **UCSF's Care Ecosystem**, implementing a 7-step protocol algorithm for clinical recommendations[cite: 15].

### 🏎️ Solving the "Latency Problem"
[cite_start]During my time at **Strategic Risk Solutions**, I transformed a sluggish AI search tool into a production-ready asset[cite: 17, 20].
* [cite_start]**The Win:** Inherited a RAG chatbot for insurance queries and **reduced latency from 32 seconds to 2-3 seconds** through aggressive caching and query optimization[cite: 19, 20].
* [cite_start]**The Infrastructure:** Designed an automated ingestion pipeline integrating Azure Blob Storage with AI Search, improving retrieval accuracy by **35%**[cite: 21].

### 💻 Native Craftsmanship
[cite_start]I have a deep interest in how software interacts with hardware and systems[cite: 30, 35].
* **Notch-Prompter:** Instead of ignoring the MacBook notch, I turned it into a tool. [cite_start]Using **AppKit and Carbon APIs**, I built a native teleprompter that detects screen geometry to adapt the UI based on hardware specs[cite: 33, 35, 36].
* [cite_start]**Virtual Systems:** To explore OS internals, I architected a **Unix-like file system** from scratch, featuring hierarchical directory structures, path resolution, and a custom command parser with 15+ commands[cite: 28, 30, 31].

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
* [cite_start]**Languages:** Python, C++, C, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift [cite: 8, 33]
* [cite_start]**Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Flask, PyTorch, SwiftUI [cite: 8, 33]
* [cite_start]**Cloud & Tools:** Azure (AI Search/Blob), AWS (EC2), Docker, Git, PostGIS [cite: 8, 21, 37, 41]

## 🎵 Beyond the Code
When I'm not in the terminal, I’m exploring **Audio DSP**. I’m fascinated by signal processing and look forward to blending my computer science background with real-time audio synthesis and music technology.

## 📊 Stats & Impact
* [cite_start]**90%** reduction in LLM query latency[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**88k+** medical records processed via custom parsers[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Sub-100ms** latency achieved in real-time messaging systems[cite: 39].
